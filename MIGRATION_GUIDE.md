### 3. Product Management Testing

- [ ] Product list loads and displays correctly
- [ ] Search functionality filters products by name and SKU
- [ ] Create new product form validation works
- [ ] Create new product adds to list successfully
- [ ] Delete product removes from list with confirmation
- [ ] Stock level color coding works (green/yellow/red)
- [ ] Form resets after successful creation

### 4. Customer Management Testing

- [ ] Create new customer form validation works
- [ ] Create new customer adds to list successfully
- [ ] Delete customer removes from list with confirmation

- [ ] Revenue and transaction totals calculate correctly
- [ ] Average transaction calculation is accurate
- [ ] Top-selling products table displays correctly
- [ ] Empty report states display appropriately
- [ ] Loading states show during report generation

### 6. UI/UX Testing

- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile devices
- [ ] Navigation between pages works correctly
- [ ] Active page highlighting in navigation
- [ ] Loading states display during API calls
- [ ] Error messages display clearly
- [ ] Success messages display and auto-dismiss
- [ ] Form validation provides helpful feedback
- [ ] Icons and visual elements render correctly

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+ (for backend)
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
- npm or yarn

### Running in Development Mode

1. **Start the Go Backend:**
   ```bash
   # From project root
   go run ./cmd/server
   ```
   Backend will be available at `http://localhost:8081`

2. **Start the Next.js Frontend:**
   ```bash
   # From project root
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Access the Application:**
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### API Communication

The Next.js frontend communicates with the Go backend via API calls to `http://localhost:8081/api/*`. The API service layer handles:

- Automatic error handling and parsing
- Type-safe request/response handling
- Consistent error messaging
- Request/response transformation

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Development Mode (Recommended for Testing)

Run both servers separately as described above. This provides:
- Hot reloading for frontend changes
- Full development tools and debugging
- Separate error handling and logging

### Option 2: Production Build (Future Enhancement)

For production deployment, the Next.js app can be built as static files and served by the Go backend. This requires:

1. Building the Next.js app with static export
2. Updating the Go router to serve the built files
3. Handling client-side routing properly

## Migration Benefits

### Developer Experience
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents runtime errors
- **Component Reusability**: React components reduce code duplication
- **Modern Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, and Next.js dev tools
- **Hot Reloading**: Instant feedback during development

### User Experience
- **Improved Performance**: React's virtual DOM and Next.js optimizations
- **Better Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first Tailwind CSS approach
- **Loading States**: Better feedback during API operations

### Maintainability
- **Structured Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **API Service Layer**: Centralized API communication
- **Context Management**: Centralized state management
- **Type Definitions**: Self-documenting code with TypeScript

## Known Limitations

1. **Static Export**: Currently configured for static export but not fully implemented
2. **Authentication**: Still uses simple ID-based authentication (matches original)
3. **Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket support (matches original)
4. **Offline Support**: No offline capabilities (matches original)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Production Build Pipeline**: Complete static export setup
2. **Enhanced Authentication**: JWT tokens and proper session management
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live inventory updates
4. **Progressive Web App**: Offline support and mobile app features
5. **Advanced Reporting**: Charts and graphs for sales analytics
6. **Inventory Alerts**: Low stock notifications
7. **Multi-user Support**: Role-based permissions and user management
